# Origin

A collection of shell scripts and automation tools for setting up and configuring various operating systems, services, and environments.

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and run any script directly:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> origin
cd origin
bash ubuntu/basics-ubuntu.sh
```

Most scripts are standalone and can be executed individually.

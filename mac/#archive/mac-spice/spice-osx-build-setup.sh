# Script that sets up jhbuild for SPICE OS X building. Run this to
# checkout jhbuild and the required configuration.

#
# Run this whenever you want to update jhbuild or the jhbuild setup;
# it is safe to run it repeatedly. Note that it overwrites
# ~/.jhbuildrc however. Custom settings should be kept in
# ~/.jhbuildrc-custom.
#
# You need Mac OS X 10.4 or newer and Xcode 2.5 or newer. Make sure
# you have subversion (svn) installed, 10.5 has it by default.
#
# Quick HOWTO:
#
# sh spice-osx-build-setup.sh
#
# export JHB=spice
# jhbuild bootstrap
# jhbuild build
#
# See http://spice-space.org/page/OSX_Client/Build for more information.
